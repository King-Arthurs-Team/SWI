With minimul installation and configuration required.\r\nSWI is a fork of EGs (https://bitbucket.org/jnewing/egs) with some bug fixes, cosmetic improvements and additional features and consoles in\r\nan effort to give users of networks running Atheme Services the ultimate control over their IRC accounts, nicknames, channels, memos, vhosts\r\nand BotServ use via the World Wide Web.\r\n\r\n## Notable New Features:\r\n\r\n    1) NickServ Settings page\r\n\t2) ChanServ Settings page\r\n\t3) ChanServ WAITING list added to OperServ dashboard for networks running chanserv/moderate with Atheme (optional)\r\n\t4) HostServ WAITING list added to OperServ dashboard (optional)\r\n\t5) BotServ consoles added: BOTLIST, ASSIGN, UNASSIGN and BOT MANAGEMENT (add/change/delete) for Services Operators\r\n    6) Current Sessions page added to main dashboard\r\n\t7) Facebook & Twitter links for networks (customizable)\r\n\t8) GroupServ console & functionality added (optional)\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\n\thttp://www.IRC4Fun.net/live/\r\n- - -\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\nIf you need support please come talk to me on /server -m irc.IRC4Fun.net in #SWI however before doing that make sure you read this file, at\r\nleast twice.  You can also find me on AthemeNet (irc.atheme.org) in #SWI\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nDuring this installation I'm going to assume a few things.\r\n\r\n    1) that you know your way around a shell\r\n    2) that you have some understanding of the mysql cli client tool\r\n    3) That you have Atheme IRC Services running with both the httpd and xmlrpc modules running.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst your going to need to obtain a copy of SWI one can be found here\r\n\r\n\thttp://irc4fun.github.io/SWI/\r\n\r\nNext up you're going to have to edit the swi/config/config.php file to reflect the settings of your web server and Atheme installation.\r\n\r\nCleaner URI's (**Optional**)\r\n\r\nYou may want to remove the index.php in the URI.\r\n\r\n\thttp://www.yournetwork.net/swi/index.php/more/stuffhere\r\n\r\nto something like\r\n\r\n\thttp://www.yournetwork.net/swi/more/stuffhere\r\n\r\nThis is current supported on Apache, Lighttpd, Nginx and any other web server that supports some form of URI re-writing. Below I've included a few example of re-writes.\r\n\r\n**Apache**\r\n\r\n\t<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>\r\n\t\tRewriteEngine On\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t# You need to change the path to match that of your installation.\r\n\t\t# For example if you installed the SWI system to http://www.yournetwork.net/swi/ you would \r\n\t\t# change that line to read:\r\n    \t# RewriteBase /swi/\r\n\t\t#     \r\n\t\t# Alternately if your install was located on a subdomain example: http://services.yournetwork.net \r\n\t\t# we would change the RewriteBase line to read:\r\n\t\t# RewriteBase /\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tRewriteBase /swi/\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^system.*\r\n\t\tRewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php?/$1 [L]\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^application.*\r\n\t\tRewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php?/$1 [L]\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\r\n\t\tRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\r\n\t\tRewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?/$1 [L]\r\n\t</IfModule>\r\n\t\r\n\t<IfModule !mod_rewrite.c>\r\n\t\tErrorDocument 404 /index.php\r\n\t</IfModule>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Lighthttpd**\r\n\r\n\turl.rewrite-once = (\r\n \t\t\"/(.*)\\.(.*)\" => \"$0\",\r\n \t\t\"/(css|files|img|js|stats)/\" => \"$0\",\r\n \t\t\"^/([^.]+)$\" => \"/index.php/$1\"\r\n\t)\r\n\r\n**Nginx**\r\n\r\n \tserver {\r\n    \r\n    \tlisten   80;\r\n    \t\r\n    \troot /var/www/nginx-default/;\r\n    \taccess_log  /var/log/nginx/localhost.access.log;\r\n    \tindex index.php index.html index.htm;\r\n\r\n    \terror_page 500 502 503 504  /50x.html;\r\n\t\r\n    \tlocation /swi/ {\r\n        \t\r\n        \tif (-f $request_filename) {\r\n            \texpires max;\r\n            \tbreak;\r\n        \t}\r\n    \t\r\n        \tif (!-e $request_filename) {\r\n            \trewrite ^/swi/(.*)$ /swi/index.php/$1 last;\r\n        \t}\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tlocation = /50x.html {\r\n        \troot /var/www/nginx-default;\r\n    \t}\r\n\t\r\n    \tlocation /swi/index.php {\r\n        \tfastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;\r\n        \tfastcgi_index index.php;\r\n        \tfastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /var/www/nginx-default/swi/index.php;\r\n        \tinclude fastcgi_params;\r\n    \t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n - - -\r\n\r\n## Finished\r\n\r\nThat's it!
