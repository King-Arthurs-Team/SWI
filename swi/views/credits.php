				<small>Services Web Interface version 3 (SWI3) is a fork of <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jnewing/egs" target="_blank">EGs Web Panel</a>, created by <a href="http://epicgeeks.net" target="_blank">synmuffin</a> <i>(we and our users loved the interface!)</i> which we used as a base to start with.</small>

							<small>We have fixed various bugs and made some outputs from commands display better or a bit more visually pleasing.  We've also added lots of additional functionality to various dashboards/consoles and have more plans & features in store for the near future!</small>

Our <b>Services Web Interface v3</b> would not have been possible without the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jnewing/egs" target="_blank">EGs Web Panel</a> as a starting point.</small>
