				<small>Services Web Interface version 3 (SWI3) is a fork of <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jnewing/egs" target="_blank">EGs Web Panel</a>, created by synmuffin. <i>(we and our users loved the interface!)</i> which we used as a base to start with.  SWI can be found at <a href="http://www.Xtheme.org/SWI/">http://www.Xtheme.org/SWI</a></small>

							<small>We have fixed various bugs and made some outputs from commands display better or a bit more visually pleasing.  We've also added lots of additional functionality and support for services such as <strong>BotServ & GroupServ</strong>, social media and have more plans & features in store for the near future!</small>
